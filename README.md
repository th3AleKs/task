# To Do App 📝

The To Do App is a web application that allows you to add tasks, mark them complete, and delete them. This in order to help you manage day-to-day tasks in an easier and more organized way.

## How it works?

To start using the To Do App, simply visit the website and click on the input box. Enter a description of the task and click on the "plus icon" to add it to your list. Once you've completed a task, mark it as done by clicking on the checkbox on the left. If you want to delete a task, click on the trash icon on the right.

Also in the profile tab, you can see some information about you, like the total of tasks that were added, and the total of completed tasks. Also, you can add your name in the profile section!
